## How to Use

1. Open the `macOS.html` to initiate the terminal simulation.
2. Type `startup_Page();` and press Enter.
3. Watch the simulated loading process complete with a dynamic progress bar.
4. Upon completion, the terminal will close, and you will be redirected to `index.html`.
5. A welcome message will fade in along with two buttons, completing the transition to the static webpage.
